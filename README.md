# Cubit & Sqflite Practice App


This Flutter project serves as a practical playground for exploring Cubit state management and Sqflite database interactions. It provides a structured environment to experiment with data persistence, user interface updates based on data changes, and Cubit's concepts for managing app state effectively.

**Key Features:**
